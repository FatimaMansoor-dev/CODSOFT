Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository on GitHub! This repository contains three data science projects that I have worked on. Each project is briefly described below, along with the technologies and tools used.

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
### Description
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is focused on predicting the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. This project utilizes a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5 is included for user-friendly interactions.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- PyQt5 (for GUI)

## Project 2: Car Sales Price Prediction
### Description
The Car Sales Price Prediction project aims to predict the selling price of cars based on their features, such as model, mileage, and year of manufacture. This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of regression algorithms to make price predictions.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
### Description
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. It involves a classification problem where the goal is to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This project uses various machine learning algorithms to create a model for fraud detection.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Titanic_Survival_Prediction**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and GUI code for the Titanic Survival Prediction project.
- **Car_Sales_Price_Prediction**: Includes the Jupyter Notebook for the Car Sales Price Prediction project.
- **Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for the Credit Card Fraud Detection project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder you're interested in.

3. Follow the project-specific README and Jupyter Notebook to understand the project and its implementation.
